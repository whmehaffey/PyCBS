 Simple Python (2.7) based verson of the old CBS program.  Plots RMS of audio input, lets you choose sound devices, can be run  concurrently, and records in mono or stereo .WAV format, can be triggered off L/R channels if necessary for,, e.g., TAF or other strange triggers if you prefer.

Or there's a compiled Win32 version. 

From the original documentation of the orignal CBS (Catch Bird Singing, by David Perkel), 

"Also, I am not a programmer, so I don't want to hear complaints.  I know it
isn't written well.  However, I would love to hear suggestions, even things
that may seem obvious."
